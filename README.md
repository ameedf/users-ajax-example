# users-ajax-example
The index.html contains the solution for the folowing task - so be sure to only look at it if you encounter some difficulties !
## The task:
Read how to activate the API at 'https://reqres.in', then call the API 'https://reqres.in/api/users?page=<<SOME_PAGE>>' to display the images of the users.

The HTML will display the current page, and will have 2 buttons: 'previous page' and 'next page'. when hitting on one of them, the page will load the users of the relevant page, and then render the users, and the new page number.
Each user will be rendered as a div that contains:
  h2 -> user full name</h2>
  br
  img with src="user.avatar"

Good luck
